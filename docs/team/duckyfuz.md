## Project: FinTrack

FinTrack is a lightweight command-line assistant that helps you keep an eye on day-to-day spending and income. It is designed for users who prefer a fast, keyboard-first workflow without navigating complex spreadsheets.

The following is the link to my code contribution to this project: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2526s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=duckyfuz&breakdown=true)

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature**: Implement the `edit-expense` command

  - What it does: Allows users to modify an existing expense entry at a specified index, updating its amount, category, date, and description.
  - Justification: Enables users to correct mistakes or update records without deleting and re-adding expenses, improving usability and data integrity.
  - Highlights: Ensures robust validation, preserves chronological order, and provides clear feedback on successful edits or errors.

- **New Feature**: Implement the `edit-income` command

  - What it does: Lets users update an existing income entry at a specified index, changing its amount, category, date, and description.
  - Justification: Offers flexibility to maintain accurate income records and reduces friction when updating past entries.
  - Highlights: Shares a consistent interface and validation logic with `edit-expense`, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **New Feature**: Implement the `export` command

  - What it does: Exports all financial data (incomes, expenses, and summary) to a CSV file for backup or analysis in spreadsheet applications.
  - Justification: Provides users with data portability and the ability to analyze or archive their finances outside the app.
  - Highlights: Follows Single Responsibility Principle by delegating file I/O to a dedicated storage layer, and produces a well-formatted, standards-compliant CSV output.

- **Enhancements**:

  - Implement atomic `Modify Income / Expense` instructions for enhanced reliability.
  - Wrote tests for coverage of `FinanceManager` class and `Modify Income / Expense` methods. [#38](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W12-4/tp/pull/38) , [#87](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W12-4/tp/pull/87)
  - Write tests to ensure atomicity of `Modify Income / Expense` methods. [#87](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W12-4/tp/pull/87)
