/' Budget setting flow (at object level):

/' Adding an expense (object placement into list) '/
e1 --- expenses

/' Budget check semantics (captured as a note on fm):
   On fm.addExpense(e):
   - look up b = budgets.get(e.category)
   - if b exists and totalBefore<=b and (totalBefore + e.amount) > b
       => trigger budget exceeded alert

/' Visual emphasis: budgets belongs to fm '/
