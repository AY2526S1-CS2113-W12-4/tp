# FinTrack User Guide

## Introduction

FinTrack is a lightweight command-line assistant that helps you keep an eye on day-to-day spending and income. It is designed for users who prefer a fast, keyboard-first workflow without navigating complex spreadsheets. This guide explains how to install FinTrack, enter your transactions, and understand the feedback shown in the terminal.

**Important:** FinTrack does not store data between sessions. Once you exit the app, every expense and income you entered is permanently cleared, so export or record anything you need before closing it.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Java 17.** FinTrack requires Java 17. Confirm your version with `java -version`.
2. **Download or clone FinTrack.** Place the project folder anywhere on your computer.
3. **Open a terminal at the project root.** On Windows you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell; on macOS/Linux use your preferred shell.
4. **Run FinTrack from source.**
    - Windows: `.\gradlew.bat run`
    - macOS/Linux: `./gradlew run`
      FinTrack will compile (on first run) and display a welcome banner followed by a `>` prompt.
    - **Reminder:** Data exists only for the current run. Keep the app open while working, and export it if you need a record before exiting.
5. *(Optional)* Build a runnable JAR with `./gradlew shadowJar` (macOS/Linux) or `.\gradlew.bat shadowJar` (Windows). The application JAR is created under `build/libs/`.

Tip: Type `help` after launch to see every available command.

## Getting to Know FinTrack

- FinTrack is fully keyboard-driven. Each command is entered on a single line and confirmed with Enter.
- Commands are **case-sensitive**. Use lowercase as shown in this guide (e.g., `add-expense`, not `Add-Expense`).
- Parameters use prefixes:
    - `a/` for amount (non-negative number, decimals allowed).
    - `c/` for category (must be from the valid list of categories).
- `d/` for date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (must not be in the future).
    - `des/` for an optional description. If omitted, the entry has no description.
- Compulsory parameters can be input in **any order**. For example, if `add-expense` requires the `a/<amount>`, `c/<category>` and `d/<YYYY-MM-DD>` parameters, it can be input in any order (e.g. `c/<category>`, `a/<amount>`, `d/<YYYY-MM-DD>`).
  - However, if you include the optional description (`des/`), place it after all other parametersâ€”everything after `des/` is treated as part of the description.
- Dates must be valid calendar dates (for example, `2025-02-29` is invalid) and cannot be later than today.
- FinTrack keeps data only while it is running. Closing the application clears all records.

## Features

  ```
  Expense added:
    Amount: 12.50
    Category: FOOD
    Date: 2025-10-08
    Description: Lunch with friends

Validation notes:
- Amount must be a non-negative number (e.g., `5`, `14.20`).
- Category and date are mandatory.
- Description is optional; omit it entirely if not needed.

  --------------------------------------------------
  ```

If there are no expenses, FinTrack prints `No expenses recorded.`

#### Filtering by month (for list-expense)

You can add the optional `d/<YYYY-MM>` field to show expenses only from that month.
For example, `list-expense d/2025-10` lists only expenses recorded in **October 2025**.

- **Sample output:**

    ```
    Expenses for the month 2025-10 (Newest first):

    ```
    Incomes for the month 2025-12 (Newest first):

    Date: 2025-12-01
    Amount: $3200.00
    Category: SALARY

For example, `balance d/2025-01` displays the total income, expenses, and balance for **January 2025**.

- **Example usage:** `balance d/2025-01`
- **Sample output:**

    ```
    Overall Balance for the month 2025-01: 3158.00
    Total Income: 3200.00
    Total Expense: 42.00
    ```

### Deleting an expense: `delete-expense`

Removes an expense by its 1-based index as seen in the most recent `list-expense` output.

- **Format:** `delete-expense <index>`
- **Example usage:** `delete-expense 2`
- **Sample output:**

  ```
  Expense deleted (index 2):
    Amount: 12.50
    Category: FOOD

FinTrack rejects zero or negative indexes and any index larger than the number of expenses.

### Deleting an income: `delete-income`

Removes an expense by its 1-based index as seen in the most recent `list-income` output.

  Income deleted (index 1):
    Amount: 3200.00

  ```

### Modifying an expense: `modify-expense`

Updates an existing expense entry at a specified index. The new entry replaces the old one and is re-sorted by date if necessary.

- **Format:** `modify-expense <index> a/<amount> c/<category> d/<YYYY-MM-DD> [des/<description>]`
- **Example usage:** `modify-expense 1 a/1300 c/Rent d/2024-01-01 des/Monthly rent increased`
- **Sample output:**
  ```
  Expense at index 1 modified to:
    Amount: 1300.00
    Category: RENT
    Date: 2024-01-01
    Description: Monthly rent increased
  ```

Validation notes:

- Index must be a valid, existing expense index (as shown in `list-expense`).
- All other validation rules are the same as for `add-expense`.
- Entering a future date triggers the same `Date cannot be in the future.` error as the add command.
- If the modification causes the category budget to be exceeded, a warning is shown.

### Modifying an income: `modify-income`

Updates an existing income entry at a specified index. The new entry replaces the old one and is re-sorted by date if necessary.

- **Example usage:** `modify-income 3 a/250 c/Salary d/2024-01-15 des/Extra performance bonus`
- **Sample output:**
  ```
  Income at index 3 modified to:
    Amount: 250.00
    Category: SALARY
    Date: 2024-01-15
    Description: Extra performance bonus
  ```

Validation notes:

- **Example usage:** `bye`
- **Sample output:**

  ```
  Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
  ```

You can also close the terminal window, but `bye` ensures the farewell message is shown.

### Exporting your data: `export`

Exports all incomes and expenses to a CSV file for use in spreadsheet applications or backups.

- **Format:** `export <filepath>`
- **Example usage:** `export financial_data.csv`
- **Sample output:**
  ```
  Successfully exported data to: /path/to/financial_data.csv
  ```

Notes:

- The CSV file will contain all incomes and expenses in a single table, with a `Type` column to distinguish between them.
- The file can be opened in Excel, Google Sheets, or any compatible application.
- If the export fails (e.g., due to permissions), an error message is shown.

## Error Handling

- Invalid commands or parameters print a single line beginning with `Error:`, for example `Error: Amount must be a valid number.`
- The original data remains unchanged when an error occurs.
- Use `help` whenever you are unsure of the required format.
- If any test pertaining to `tips` fails, you should try to run the test again. As tips relies on random number generation, there is a chance that the test can fail due to sheer unluckiness. While it is statistically unlikely the test fails, it is not impossible.

## FAQ

**Q: Does FinTrack save my data between sessions?**  
A: Not yet. All data resides in memory. Export important figures before exiting.

**Q: How do I update an entry?**  
A: Modify the entry (`modify-expense` or `modify-income`) with the correct format.

**Q: Why do I see "Amount must be a valid number"?**  
A: FinTrack only accepts standard numbers without currency symbols (e.g., use `a/15.90`, not `a/$15.90`).

**Q: Can I enter dates in other formats such as DD-MM-YYYY?**  
A: No. FinTrack currently requires ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Q: How can I review transactions for a specific month?**  
A: Use the optional month filter on incomes (`list-income d/<YYYY-MM>`).

**Q: Can descriptions include spaces?**  
A: Yes. However, descriptions must be the last argument declared, as `des/` will consume the rest of the line.

**Q: Why was my date rejected even though it looks correct?**  
A: Ensure the date is valid on the calendar and in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
